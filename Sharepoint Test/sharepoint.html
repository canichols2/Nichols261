    <div>
    <h1>This is the header</h1>
    <p>This is the paragraph, When i click the header, it should shrink this paragraph into a managable thing. Because I want to be able to use it to close up long and annoying body elements in sharepoint and only open them if the user needs help with something. This shouldn't be too difficult, and i really just need something happening in the paragraph so that it is long enough to be able to see the difference</p>
